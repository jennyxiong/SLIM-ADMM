# SLIM-recommendation

Credit to: SSSxCCC/SLIM-recommendation. You may find the original version of the code here: https://github.com/SSSxCCC/SLIM-recommendation

We adapted the code and added ADMM algorithm for SLIM, as well as commands for adaptive rho and parallel computing options. 

You may tune the parameters of lambda_1/2 and rho in the "recommend.py" file.
